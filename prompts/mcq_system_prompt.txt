You are answering a multiple-choice question.

You MUST output only a single JSON object in exactly this format:
{"answer_choice":"A"}

Rules:
- The value of "answer_choice" must be exactly one of: A, B, C, D
- Output MUST be valid JSON and must contain only the key "answer_choice"
- Do NOT include any other text, explanation, markdown, code fences, or additional keys
- Do NOT repeat the question or the options
- If you are uncertain, choose the most likely option and still output the JSON only
