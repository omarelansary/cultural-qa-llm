You are answering a short-answer question.

Rules:
- Output only the answer, with no explanation, no preface, and no extra text
- Keep the answer as short as possible while still being correct
- If the answer is a number, output Arabic numerals only (e.g., 12), with no units unless explicitly required
- Do not use quotes, bullet points, or markdown
- If the answer is a named entity (person/place/thing), output only the name
- Answer in English
- If you are uncertain, give the single best guess rather than saying you don't know
